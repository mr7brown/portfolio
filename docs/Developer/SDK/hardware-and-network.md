# Configure and Test Audio

<!-- :::note Note:

For this doc, I was the sole author. To write this Raspberry Pi configuration doc, I worked directly with Google engineers to test and configure the Pi to configuire and test the USB microphone/speaker.

The software and tools used to complete this doc can be found under **Tags** at the end of the doc.

## Overview

Prior to prototyping, it is recommended that you use the [Raspberryi Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
(Pi) to embed the Google Assistant and create custom actions that will work with
your device. This page provides a brief introduction to the Pi, the hardware
required to embed the Assistant, and how to install the Google Assistant SDK.

### Required hardware

Before configuring your Pi, you will need the following components:

- Micro-USB cable
- USB microphone (see [recommended](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3367))
- Speaker (see recommended [USB](https://www.adafruit.com/products/3369) or [3.5mm-jack](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14023))
- Ethernet cable (if you are not using WiFi)
- MicroSD card reader
- 8 GB or larger microSD card (with [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/) pre-installed)

If you plan to connect the Pi to an external monitor, then you may also need:

- HDMI cable
- HDMI-enabled display
- USB mouse
- USB keyboard

### Connect Raspberry Pi

1. Insert micro SD card into your Pi.
2. Plug in USB microphone and USB or 3.5 mm speaker.
3. Connect the keyboard and mouse using the USB ports (be sure not to cover your
   USB microphone if using one).
4. Connect monitor using the HDMI port.
5. Connect the ethernet Cable (if you are not using [Wi-Fi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/desktop.md)
   on your Pi).

Once the Pi is connected, boot it up and follow the prompts and recommended
settings until the Pi's home screen displays.

### Configure and test the audio

Before installing the sample code, you need to configure the Pi to use your microphone and speaker.

1. Locate USB microphone in your Pi.

- You will need to write down or copy the card number and device number.

```
$ arecord -1
```

2. Locate speaker (USB and 3.5 mm speakers have the same process).

- Write down or copy the card and device numbers.

```
$ aplay-1
```

3. From the home directory (`/home/pi`) create a file named `.asoundrc`.
4. Update the `.asoundrc` file with the correct slave definitions for microphone
   and speaker.

- Use the configuration below, but replace `<card number>` and `<device number>`
  with the card and device numbers that were copied in the previous steps. Complete this for
  both `pcm.mic` and `pcm.speaker`.

```
pcm.!default {
  type asym
  capture.pcm "mic"
  playback.pcm "speaker"
}
pcm.mic {
  type plug
  slave {
    pcm "hw:<card number>,<device number>"
  }
}
pcm.speaker {
  type plug
  slave {
    pcm "hw:<card number>,<device number>"
  }
}
```

5. Play a test sound. If you hear the sound, press <b>Ctrl+C</b>.

```
$ speaker-test -t wav
```

- If you do not hear a sound, try adjusting the volume. (Press the up arrow key
  to set the playback volume level to around 70.)

```
$ alsamixer
```

6. Record an audio clip.

```
$ arecord --format=S16_LE --duration=5 --rate=16000 --file-type=raw out.raw
```

7. Playback the recording.

```
$ aplay --format=S16_LE --rate=16000 out.raw
```

If the audio recording and playback is working, then the initial configuration
is complete. If not, check the microphone and speaker connections and try
again.
