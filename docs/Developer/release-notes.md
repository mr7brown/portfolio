# HBO Max Release Notes

:::note Note:

This page is not reflective of an actual document sent to partners. Rather it is an overview of the release notes, and the site (which I built) that the release notes are for.

:::

The release notes are produced for partners that deliver content into the HBO Max pipeline. Release notes are now sent in an automated message, similar to the format on this page.

In addition to the automated message, HBO partners are also directed to HBO's Partner Hub.
