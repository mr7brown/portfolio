# Welcome to Ashton's Portfolio

Here is a collection of projects I've completed over the past decade. Each project is grouped according to the intended audience. At the top of each doc is an introduction to the doc, including: my role in the project, doc publishing, and where I obtained the information to create the content.

## Site Navigation

1. The `sidebar` provides a user experience similar to many leading developer documentation portals.
2. Alternatively, tool-specific docs can be found by using the search component in th `navbar` or by clicking on one of the `Tags` below or at the end of each doc.
