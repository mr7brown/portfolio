Stem Cell Therapy Aims at Repair</h1><p>Science and medicine have come a long way since multiple sclerosis was first considered a diagnosis in the 1800s. Since that time, we have advanced to many different types of therapies. One of the newest treatments available is stem cell therapy.</p><p>Stem cells are like a clean slate of cells waiting to figure out their purpose in the human body. Several different approaches to stem cell therapies are being considered as options for MS therapy. BrainStorm, one of the companies studying stem cell therapy, went a step further and will be using mesenchymal stem cells to try and create a therapeutic treatment. They developed a technology called NurOwn, which is currently showing positive results in a Phase II study of their stem cell therapy. Dr. Jeffrey Cohen, director of experimental therapeutics at the Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center for MS and principal investigator for the trial recently discussed the research and its prospective future.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you explain in layman terms the mechanism of action of the three-dose NurOwn treatment?</p><p><strong>Dr. Cohen:</strong> We have a broad number of choices of DMTs that prevent the ongoing activity of the disease and slow the accumulation of damage. But none of those treatments promote repair, which is a big unmet need, particularly in progressive MS. So, one of the approaches that’s been used to try and promote repair is stem cell transplantation and there are several different strategies utilizing this mechanism. The way our strategy works is using so-called mesenchymal stem cells, which are a kind of stem cell that’s present in most of the tissues of the body, whose job is to promote the natural repair processes in that tissue. So that’s the basis of this approach, which is to administer a large dose of mesenchymal stem cells to try and promote repair in the nervous system.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the NurOwn technology differ from other mesenchymal studies that are also being used?</p><p><strong>Dr. Cohen:</strong> Many of the other studies have used unmodified mesenchymal stem cells, where they are grown in culture to increase their numbers, but their characteristics aren’t modified. For our technology, we have modified these cells to try and make them more potent so we may amplify higher levels of certain factors. The second difference is that many of the previous studies, including one we did several years ago, would only administer a single dose, which did not show much adequacy. Now, we will be administering three doses. The third and most important difference is that previously, the doses were administered intravenously. In this study, we administer them via spinal tap, which is much more effective, and the cells are much closer to where they are needed in the body.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> NurOwn technology is currently being used to treat ALS, Lou Gehrig’s Disease, as an orphan drug. How did that inspire using the same technology to potentially treat the progression of MS in people?</p><p><strong>Dr. Cohen:</strong> The rationale for administering those cells in ALS was to try and promote repair of the type of damage that occurs within that disease. A lot of practical lessons were learned from that trial both on how to grow the cells and how to ship the cells to a cell production facility and back to the sites. The administration of the cells in ALS was very well tolerated so we expected similar in MS, although every disease is different.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Will this treatment be more preferred in one age group versus another? Is it more helpful in the middle-aged population versus adolescent?</p><p><strong>Dr. Cohen:</strong> So there has been a lot of discussion among investigators about all of this. The elder population with a more long-standing severe disease need the treatment, but one of the concerns has been that it may be getting rather late at that point. The nervous system may not be able to repair itself, whereas very young patients with a relatively recent onset of MS can repair better but they may not need the treatment. So, there is some sweet spot and that is what we are looking for in this study.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does MSC-NTF cell therapy differ from other types of studies published regarding autoimmune treatments, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy for MS?</p><p><strong>Dr. Cohen:</strong> The difference is the purpose of both types of therapies. HSCT is primarily an anti-inflammatory approach, it’s like a souped-up version of DMTs – the intent is stop ongoing inflammation. The MSC-NTF therapy is intended to promote repair, which is a different goal altogether.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you see this changing the way physicians will start looking at MS or possibly trying to treat MS?</p><p><strong>Dr. Cohen:</strong> We’re now starting to realize the mechanisms that lead to progression in MS, which are probably present and play a role right from the beginning of the disease. Their effects become more apparent over time, and the disease probably evolves gradually as well. Our previous categorization of patients was relapsing-remitting, primary progressive, and secondary progressive MS, which are somewhat artificial. All the mechanisms for all those stages are present to varying degrees throughout the disease. So, I suspect that in the future, when we have repair or neuroprotective promoting strategies, they’ll be combined from the beginning with the anti-inflammatory DMTs, and we can try to treat all aspects of the disease all at once.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you see the future of NurOwn technology advancing and potential treatment options?</p><p><strong>Dr. Cohen:</strong> Even though the results of this study were very encouraging and very promising, it was a relatively small study, and it was uncontrolled, meaning everybody in the study received the treatment, whether it was one, two, or all three doses. So, the results need to be interpreted with some caution. We were very pleased with the results, but you know there’s also possibility that at least some of them were due to the placebo effect. The next step will be most likely to carry out a more definitive controlled study where some people get treatment and others do not.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Where do you see this research continuing in the future?</p><p><strong>Dr. Cohen:</strong> My expectation is that the results from this study will lead to another study in the future, possibly a double-blinded one. The sponsor for this study is currently discussing options about a future study with the FDA.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/docs/Articles/MSStem.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/portfolio/docs/intro"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Introduction</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/portfolio/docs/Articles/MSDietaryJourney"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Life with MS—Tech Support for your Dietary Journey</div></a></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 Bhavya Suri</div></div></div></footer></div>
