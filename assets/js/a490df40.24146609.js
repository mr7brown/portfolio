But none of those treatments promote repair, which is a big unmet need, particularly in progressive MS. So, one of the approaches that\u2019s been used to try and promote repair is stem cell transplantation and there are several different strategies utilizing this mechanism. The way our strategy works is using so-called mesenchymal stem cells, which are a kind of stem cell that\u2019s present in most of the tissues of the body, whose job is to promote the natural repair processes in that tissue.

The second difference is that many of the previous studies, including one we did several years ago, would only administer a single dose, which did not show much adequacy. Now, we will be administering three doses. The third and most important difference is that previously, the doses were administered intravenously.
