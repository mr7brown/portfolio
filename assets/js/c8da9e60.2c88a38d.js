With MS, there are a multitude of issues that can come such as having weakness of your facial muscles, or losing coordination of your mouth and throat muscles.

The difference between a physiatrist and a physical therapist is that the physical therapist is the one who performs the therapy. When dealing with musculoskeletal issues, such as weakness of your muscles or gait issues, your physiatrist works with you and helps to check your progress in physical therapy. The need for a physiatrist is entirely your decision. Some people go to physical therapy based on a referral from their primary care physicians and others may want to see a physiatrist, so they have a more specialized physician working alongside their treatment for muscle issues with them."),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"dietician"},"Dietician"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"With so many dietary options and opinions available on the Internet, it can become over whelming to know which type of diet should\nbe followed.

The trial-and-error method of different diets and following the many varying recipes available online may work for some, but seeing a dietician could help speed up the process. Dietitians are trained to help you identify foods that can help your body feel better and cause less fatigue. They can help you figure out ways to prepare meals that work with your schedule and with your ability to use the kitchen as well. The additional bonus to this specialty is that they can also help with swallowing problems."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"With all these different specialists available, it is worth seeing what can be done to improve your health and function.
