This practice utilizes the growing amount of data and information available at society\u2019s fingertips and uses it to understand the patterns of disease and health dynamics in populations as well as the causes of these patterns and to use this understanding to mitigate and prevent disease, and to promote health. With Google dominating the search engine market since its inception in 1998, it has become the primary vehicle for many to obtain information about a condition, the treatments used, and their side effects. Through Google Trends and the five selected terms, we obtained data to compare to the annual prescription count to analyze consumer consumption of the two main drugs that were being used to treat GERD, Omeprazole, and Ranitidine. With the usage of Google Trends, we can see how the ease of access to information has altered the intake of medications and influenced consumers to self-diagnose and treat. By comparing Google Trends with the prescription count of Omeprazole and Ranitidine in the population of this country in the past 10 years, we illustrated a strong correlation between the usage of Google and the script count of the two medications. The influence of the media can be a factor that alters consumption, i.e. the recall of Zantac that occurred in the fall of 2019. Google Trends holds value as an observation tool for consumer utilization but it is important to note that its predictive characteristics can be influenced by the media.

GERD is one of the most common diseases in the Western world, with a prevalence of approximately 20% in adults. According to the American College of Gastroenterology, an estimated 60 million Americans at least once a month and 15 million people daily are affected by heartburn3.
