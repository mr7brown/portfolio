If we are taking a road trip, we\u2019ll get a pizza, eat some that night, and take the leftovers for lunch to our trip. We try to break up the drive.

If you are traveling by air or rail, it is good to check with a travel agent for helpful hints. Pack supplies in your carry-on. Never pack your medications or injections, CPAP, or catheters in your checked luggage.
